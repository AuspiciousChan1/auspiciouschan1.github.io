4. Children’s Privacy
Our App is designed for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.

We value your trust in providing us your information. Since we do not collect sensitive personal data, the risk of data breach is minimal. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
